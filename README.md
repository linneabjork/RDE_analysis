Code to handle and analyse data from electrochemical rotating disk electrode measurements.

* analysis_RDE contains functions to import data and calculate quantities such as the ECSA, specific and mass activitites
* run_activity is a notebook designed to analyse the activity data from a RDE measurement
* run_stability is a notbook designed to analyse the stability data from a RDE measurement

The notbooks provide a basis for how to use the defined functions and how plots can be made etc, but these can of course be modified to the user's preferences.
